        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Bread, as we all know, is a classic food item and a staple of any household.
            There are a plethora of different ways you can make bread, but today we will be
            creating a very simple base dough which we will shape into a loaf and bake.
            Nothing too elaborate, but still delicious nonetheless!
        </p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2><p>Steps:</p></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine your flour, water, salt and yeast in a bowl</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients together until they are thoroughly combined</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest for at least 1 hour</li>
            <li>Once the dough is rested, shape it inside of a baking tray</li>
            <li>Bake at 400 degrees farenheit for 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden
            </li>
